<p>The countries were separated three different ways: happiness score, development, and similar countries. All 148 countries were split into happiness tiers. The happiest 37 countries earned tier one status, followed by the next three groups of 37. Another way the countries were split up was by development status. The United Nations Development Programme categorizes countries into four categories: very high development, high development, low development, and very low development. Lastly, the outlying countries were also compared to other countries within half a standard deviation above or below the variable in use. This is what is meant by the term “similar rating” in this paper. The five outlying countries were discovered when the countries were split into their development categories. The countries that are either too happy or too sad compared to the other countries of their development status are considered outliers. The five outlying countries are Guatemala, Nicaragua, El Salvador, Bolivia, and the Philippines. All five outliers are too happy compared to countries of the same development status.</p>

<p>When testing for a correlation to a country’s happiness score, seven of the twenty-four variables were found to be significant: development, schooling, health, life expectancy, phone, infant mortality, and gross domestic product (GDP) per capita. Development quantifies the current state of development in a particular country by giving it a number of one through four with one being considered “very high development” and four being considered “very low development”. Schooling refers to the expected number of years a person spends on average in school. Health is measured by money spent per capita per year on health adjusted for purchasing power parity in U.S. dollars. Life expectancy is the average length of a person’s life. Phone is measured by the number of phones per one thousand people. Infant mortality displays the amount of deaths by infants per one thousand people. Lastly, GDP stands for gross domestic product per capita.</p>

<p>Of all countries that are outliers, Guatemala is the most extreme. Its happiness score of 6.454 puts it in the top tier of happy countries. However, the seven variables correlated with happiness tell a different story. When compared to countries with a similar happiness rating, Guatemala is far less developed. It has fewer years of schooling, spends less than a sixth of the amount of money other countries spend on health, and has a life expectancy of roughly 5.5 years fewer. Guatemala has less than half of the number of phones per one thousand people, possesses an infant mortality rate of more than 2.5 times the other countries’ average, and has less than a fourth of the average GDP per capita. It was also tied for last in development level and last in years schooling and infant mortality with countries of similar happiness.</p>

<p>El Salvador falls just outside of the top tier of happiness, but is near the top of the second highest tier and therefore it is considered a happy country. Overall, it is the forty-fourth happiest country in the world, but its development is considered “low”. As compared to Guatemala and Nicaragua, El Salvador is not as far off from countries of similar happiness in its metrics. However, it is still far enough away to be considered an outlier in terms of happiness. The country’s average years of schooling is 13.2 which is more than a year less than average. It spends less than a third of the average on health, has a life expectancy that is low by about 2.5 years, a number of phones that is just over half of the average, an infant mortality rate about 50% too high, and a GDP per capita that is less than half of the average.

They all are expected to go to school at least three years longer than average, spend at least 2.5 times more on health, have a life expectancy of nine years or longer, double the number of phones, an infant mortality rate close to zero, and GDPs per capita roughly triple the average or more. The variable that stands out the most is infant mortality. The mean for all the countries is 23.8 deaths per one thousand births while the median is fifteen deaths. Of the top five happiest countries, Denmark has the highest infant mortality rate at four deaths per one thousand births. GDP per capita has a large influence as well. When analyzing the data as a whole, six countries have outlying GDP per capita that is too high. Finland is the only top five country without an outlying GDP per capita, yet it is still well above average in terms of happiness.</p>

<p>The bottom five happiest countries in the world are Rwanda, Syria, Tanzania, Burundi, and the Central African Republic. These countries fall extremely below average in every category. The only exception is Syria, which has a better than average infant mortality rate. All of these countries go to school roughly 2.5 years less than average or shorter, spend a miniscule amount on health per person, have life expectancies at least 5.5 years shorter than average, a small number of phones, high infant mortality rates, and GDPs per capita that are one third of the average or less. The area in which these countries fall shortest is money spent on health. Of these five countries, Syria spends the most on health, but only spends $169 per person, roughly one ninth of the average. Tanzania and the Central African Republic each spend $32 per person, which is less than a 47th of the average. There are not as many outliers in the bottom five as compared to the top five, however, these countries rank consistently near the bottom in most categories.</p>

Countries considered more fragile receive a higher fragility score. Fragility has a strong correlation with happiness and development.

The Philippines is the only country that scored worse in this case. When compared to all of the countries in the dataset, the outliers are comparable to the other datapoints.

However, the data shows hours worked per week has zero correlation with happiness. All five outlying countries work at least one hour more than the 43 hour per week average of all the countries. Also, all countries except El Salvador, work more than the average low developed country. The theory that less work time leads to happiness or vice versa, as described in this case, cannot be stated. Too many countries work roughly the same number of hours to produce a correlation between average work time per week and country happiness. This is yet another empty variable.</p>

<p>The five outliers, Guatemala, Nicaragua, El Salvador, Bolivia, and the Philippines do not have the most resources, but they make the most of what they have. Due to a low level of development and high levels of poverty along with other shortcomings, these five countries possess every right to live an unhappy life. However, Latin Americans tend to live differently than other people of North America. Instead of prioritizing working toward the future, they focus more on the present. Also, they maintain close relationships to their family and friends (Haskins and Prescher). Each of these countries possess the basic necessities in order to live, in which they are grateful for (Al Jazeera). The Philippines fall into the same category, because they are generally grateful for the things they have and keep close relationships with family members and friends. One way these countries exhibit their friendships is through Facebook (Grogan). The percentage of Facebook users has a strong correlation with country happiness. Of the low developed countries, El Salvador, Bolivia, and the Philippines obtain the highest three percentages of Facebook users and a percentage above the mean of the highly developed countries. Guatemala and Nicaragua possess a fairly high percentage of Facebook users as well. This does not exactly prove that more Facebook means more happiness, but it does show an aspect of how these cultures value their friendships.</p>

<h3>Faith Increases Happiness for the Countries that Need It<a class="headerlink" href="#faith-increases-happiness-for-the-countries-that-need-it" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>The five outlying countries use faith as a means to stay happy. In Latin American countries, it is common to use one’s faith as means to overcome daily struggles (Al Jazeera). This is also thought to be true in the Philippines as they attribute some of their happiness to faith (Chua and Lorenzo). All five outliers possess an interesting similarity, they all have a high population that identifies as Catholic: 43% of people in Guatemala, 45% in Nicaragua, 39% in El Salvador, 73% in Bolivia, and 81.4% in the Philippines. The data shows countries with very high development have no correlation to Catholicism. This makes sense because they do not necessarily need faith in order to be happy since they already excel in other areas. However, the low developed countries search for other ways of happiness, such as their faith. When compared to the other low developed countries, the five outliers have a much higher percentage of their population practicing Catholicism. This is not the sole reason these five low developed countries are happier, but it gives them a possible way to boost happiness. The plot of the very high developed countries shows no correlation because these countries are already happy and do not need religion to fall back on.</p>

<h3>Low Developed Countries are Hopeful<a class="headerlink" href="#low-developed-countries-are-hopeful" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>People living in less developed countries tend to hold onto more hope in their economy than those living in highly developed nations. In order to measure economic hope, people in the surveyed countries were asked whether or not they believed the economy in their country would be better in 2018 than 2017 (Gallup). The net hope score was found by taking the percentage of optimists minus the percentage of pessimists. The reasoning for optimism towards the future stems from witnessing economic stability in other countries and slight economic improvement in their own. Much of this hope comes from young people. When they witness any sort of positive economic growth in their country, they begin to believe it will be much better in the future when they are making a living for themselves. Due to being content with their current lives as evident by high happiness ratings in the outlying countries, their worry about the future is relatively low. Because they are already happy living with just the basic necessities and close family ties, hope levels increase because they realize life can only get better.</p>

<p>The happiest countries in the world generally score well in the following categories: development, schooling, health, life expectancy, phone, infant mortality, and gross domestic product (GDP) per capita. It can be concluded that these variables cause happiness in countries to increase. The top five countries, Norway, Denmark, Iceland, Switzerland, and Finland, exemplify this by having exceptional rankings in each of these categories. The bottom five countries, Rwanda, Syria, Tanzania, Burundi, and the Central African Republic, do the same by scoring near the bottom in world in these variables. Low developed countries such as Guatemala, Nicaragua, El Salvador, Bolivia, and the Philippines, however, can still increase their happiness through other variables. For example, having more Facebook users allows these countries to add happiness. This may be because it gives them more connection to friends. Faith also allows these countries to be happier. The fact that the happiest countries have less of a connection to faith shows that faith is not essential for happiness because other factors may affect it more. However, it can add to happiness when other variables are not as present. Lastly, low developed countries tend to have more hope. This is true because people know there is room for improvement with many aspects of their country. Young people in these countries tend to have more hope because they know their country can improve over time, whereas high developed countries do not have as much room for improvement. Many other variables may exist that cause happiness to rise in specific countries. The data shows that some variables are key to obtaining a happy country, but countries can find other ways to become happy if they lack in one or many of these areas.</p>
